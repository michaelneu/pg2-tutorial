# pg2-tutorial

This repository contains sample solutions to the excercises discussed in the PG2 tutorial at the OTH Regensburg. 


### MathLabs

The MathLabs-project aims to demonstrating the structure and benefits of object oriented programming by utilizing basic mathematics and inheritance (e.g. `Parabola extends Graph`). It also features lessons about domain specific languages, graphical output and common coding interview problems. 


### ProcessingOO

An important part of the MathLabs-project is the use of the ProcessingOO library created by the University of Regensburg, which provides access to basic 2d graphics via an easy-to-use Java library. More information can be found in the [project's documentation](http://uniregensburg.github.io/ProcessingOO/docs/index.html).
